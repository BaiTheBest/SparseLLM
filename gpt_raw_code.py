# This function should be called within the loop over layers in opt_sequential.
# You will need to adapt the function signature and body to match the specifics of your model and use case.
# The code will also need additional logic to handle the inter-layer dependencies and integrate with SparseGPT's pruning solver.
# Please adjust the learning rates, number of optimization steps, and any other hyperparameters according to your requirements.

# Note: This code snippet is meant to be a template and will require further modifications and integration work.
# Make sure to test the implementation on a small scale before applying it to the full model.
